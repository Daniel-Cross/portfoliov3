      "The King Kev Quote Generator idea was manifested one day while searching for a certain quote from everybody's favourite 1970's footballer, Kevin Keegan. King Kev has a habit of saying some things that don't make sense to anyone but himself, he also happens to be incredibly unlucky, often when he's minding his own business or when he tries to do something good for someone else. Upon unsuccessfully finding a collated collection of Keggy's antics, the King Kev Quote Generator was born! It returns 50+ quotes/incidents from the great man himself at random. The website received International coverage when mentioned on a footballing podcast."
