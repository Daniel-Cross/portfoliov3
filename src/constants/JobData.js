      "The King Kev Quote Generator idea was manifested one day while searching for a certain quote from everybody's favourite 1970's footballer, Kevin Keegan. King Kev has a habit of saying some things that don't make sense to anyone but himself, he also happens to be incredibly unlucky, often when he's minding his own business or when he tries to do something good for someone else. Upon unsuccessfully finding a collated collection of Keggy's antics, the King Kev Quote Generator was born! It returns 50+ quotes/incidents from the great man himself at random. The website got National coverage in the UK when a footballing podcast gave the website a mention on a show!",

      "Real pets are great, but they do have drawbacks. They smell. Your mum might be allergic to them. Maybe you just aren't allowed one in your flat. To solve these problems, I built my own JavaScript pet instead. JavaScript pets are great. Because they're made of JavaScript, they can do literally anything, and they don't have any of the drawbacks of regular pets. This pet has all the following features: They can get older As they get older, they get hungrier and less fitYou can walk your pet to increase it's fitness. üèÉ You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. üçï You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE üíÄ If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE üò¢",
